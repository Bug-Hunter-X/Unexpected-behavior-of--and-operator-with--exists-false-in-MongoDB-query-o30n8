# MongoDB $and operator and $exists:false unexpected behavior

This repository demonstrates an issue encountered when using the `$and` operator with `$exists: false` in a MongoDB query.  The query is expected to return documents where `field1` exists and `field2` does not exist. However, in some cases, unexpected results are returned.

## Issue Description

The `$and` operator is intended to ensure all conditions within the array are met. However, when one of the conditions involves `$exists: false`, and that condition isn't met (meaning that the field exists), the entire query fails to match documents that otherwise satisfy the other conditions. This leads to unexpected results and incorrect data retrieval.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages using `npm install`.
3. Run the `bug.js` script to see the unexpected results.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` script to see the correct implementation of the query.

## Solution

The correct solution involves using the `$or` operator in conjunction with the `$exists` operator to achieve the expected behavior. Please refer to `bugSolution.js` for a working implementation.

## Additional Notes

The issue may be due to a misunderstanding of how MongoDB handles the `$exists` operator within a complex `$and` query.  Thorough testing and clear query design are recommended to avoid such problems.
